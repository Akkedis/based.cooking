# Peppermint Crisp Tart

Peppermint Crisp tart is a simple but surprisingly delicious South African tart.

- ⏲️ Prep time: 25 min
- 🍳 Fridge time: 4 hours minimum
- 🍽️ Servings: 6 - 8

## Ingredients

- Orley Whip: 250 ml |  1 cup (Can use any non-dairy cream substitute, or whipping/double cream but it may be too rich.) 
- Caramel Treat: 375 ml | 1½ cup | 1 can (Can use any caramelised condensed milk like Dulce de Leche) 
- Peppermint Crisp Chocolate: 2 bars | 100 g | 3.5 oz
- Tennis biscuits: 1.5 packs | 300 g (Use any coconut flavoured biscuit/cookie that has a fine texture such as Voortman Coconut Cookies)
- Peppermint Essence (optional): 3 - 10 drops (depending on the peppermint flavour desired) 
- Fine Sugar (optional): 1 tablespoon (e.g. castor sugar) 

## Directions

1. Butter a medium to large sized tart dish / bowl.
2. Place a layer of tennis biscuits at the bottom of the bowl. The biscuits don't need to fit perfectly.
3. Finely grate ⅔ (two thirds) of the peppermint crisp chocolate.
4. Whip the Orley Whip until thick and stiff. Whip it rather too stiff than too runny.
5. Fold in the caramelised condensed milk.
6. Add the grated peppermint crisp chocolate, peppermint essence (optional) and fine sugar (optional) and mix well.
7. Spoon about ⅓ (one third) of the mix over the first layer of biscuits and spread it out evenly.
8. Add another layer of biscuits and alternate with the mix, finishing with a layer of mix on top.
9. Crush the remaining peppermint crisp chocolate over the tart
10. Refrigerate for at least 4 hours, preferably overnight.
